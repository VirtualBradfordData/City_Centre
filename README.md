In creating an open digital twin for the City of Bradford we are helping to provide stimulus for Bradford as a leading clean growth city supporting: economic growth and investment, urban planning and regeneration, disaster planning, public participation and democratic processes, visualisation and educational resources, cultural heritage and tourism. With funding from the EU SCORE project we have developed a bespoke capture system in partnership with Bradford Metropolitan District Council that builds upon methods developed within the AHRC ‘Fragmented Heritage/ Curious Travellers’ project. This approach combines structure-from-motion photogrammetry, mobile mapping data, immersive 360 imagery, aerial imagery, LiDAR, terrestrial laser scanning and GNSS positioning.

A use case for the 3D digital twin has been developed: – https://www.local.gov.uk/case-studies/bradford-district-council-digital-twin# City_Centre
